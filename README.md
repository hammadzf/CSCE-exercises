# CSCE-exercises
This repository contains the solutions to practical exercises that I performed during the Certified STACKIT Cloud Engineer (CSCE) course. The exercises in this repository may not be exactly the same as or limited to the ones from the [official course]().

> **Important Disclaimer:** I created this repository with the purpose of keeping the notes from the course and solutions to practical exercises in one place. The notes, tips and solutions in this repository could serve those working with the STACKIT Cloud or those who are doing the CSCE course. However, this repository can serve as a basic cheatsheet at best. For detailed understanding of STACKIT Cloud concepts, the official course offered by STACKIT and the [STACKIT knowledge Base](https://docs.stackit.cloud/stackit/en/knowledge-base-85301704.html) should be your ultimate guide.

## Contribution Guidelines
I will keep adding different exercises and their solutions from different course modules. If the notes, exercises and solutions in this repo were helpful in your understanding of the STACKIT Cloud or cloud computing in general, please consider leaving a star.

If you would like to add a practical exercise or example specific to STACKIT Cloud or in general related to other technologies and concepts covered in this repository, feel free to create a pull request.
